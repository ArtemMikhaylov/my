It's just some notes of android development. 

I started to note for myself. But if you're here, you're welcome.

Be aware, I don't maintain all notes in actual state.

Some of them maybe depricated, some of them maybe really wrong. And some of them you can find usefull for youself. 

If you found this wiki usefull for yourself and found some notes are wrong, please text me, and I'll fix it.

With any suggetions text me to artem.iens@gmail.com
